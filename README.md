# **Date Library**  

Hi everyone, welcome to my **Date Library** project! ðŸŽ‰  
This library contains a collection of functions related to dates and times, designed to make date and time manipulations easier and more efficient.

---

## **Project Overview**  

The **Date Library** offers a wide range of functions to help you manage and manipulate dates and times. This includes adding or subtracting dates, comparing them, working with hours, minutes, seconds, and performing a variety of other date and time calculations.

## **Features**  

The **Date Library** includes the following features:

- **Adding Days to a Date**: Add a specified number of days to a given date.
- **Subtracting Days from a Date**: Subtract a specified number of days from a given date.
- **Date Comparison**: Compare two dates to check if one is earlier, later, or equal to the other.
- **Formatting Dates**: Convert dates into various formats for display or storage.
- **Leap Year Calculation**: Determine if a given year is a leap year.
- **Date Validation**: Check if a given date is valid (e.g., correct day, month, and year combination).
- **Days Between Dates**: Calculate the number of days between two dates.
- **Handling Time**: Add or subtract hours, minutes, and seconds to/from a date.
- **Time Comparison**: Compare two specific times to check if one is earlier or later.
- **Time Duration Calculation**: Calculate the difference between two times in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds.

## **How to Use**  

1. **Include the Library**:  
   - To use the functions, simply include the `Date.h` header file in your project.
   
2. **Explore the Functions**:  
   - Check out the `Date.h` file for the list of available functions and their descriptions.
   
3. **Example Usage**:  
   - You can call functions like `IsLeapYear(Date, int)` or `subtractDays(Date, int)` to modify a date, `addTime(Date, int hours, int minutes, int seconds)` to add time to a date, or use `compareDates(Date, Date)` to compare two dates.
   - For time operations, you can use `addHours(Date, int)`, `subtractMinutes(Date, int)`, or `calculateDuration(Time1, Time2)` to get the difference between two times.

## **Future Enhancements**  

In future updates, I plan to:
- Improve time zone handling for date and time calculations.
- Extend support for more advanced date and time formats.
- Add more utilities for working with recurring events (e.g., every X days, weeks, etc.).

## **Conclusion**  

Thank you for checking out the **Date Library**! I hope you find it useful for your date and time-related tasks. Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements, and enjoy using the library in your projects! ðŸ˜Š
